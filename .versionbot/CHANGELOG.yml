    - subject: Make rotation delay configurable
      hash: 2648f76c18c694ccf6e94ba190ffc23048952acd
      body: |
        At this point we hardcode a 3 seconds delay before applying display
        rotation, which on some systems is not enough, while on other systems
        it is too much.

        This patch exposes a `ROTATE_DELAY` variable that makes the delay
        configurable.

        Resolves: #171

    - subject: Update to Debian 11 and Node 16
      hash: 569be5de6d9296f08b636927694e915b5026c2bd
      body: |
        The block is currently based on Debian 10, however its mesa version
        is too old for RPi kernel 5.15.9 and up which results in X server
        crashing on startup.

        This patch updates the base to Debian 11 which seems to work fine.
        It also bumps node from 12 to 16 since 12 is quite old at this moment
        and not available for all the architectures in combination
        with Debian 11.

        for now, this doesn't change behavior, as we still exit the process, but
        it fixes error logging. If we don't want to exit the process we can
        change this later\r

    - subject: Fix chromium sandbox not starting
- commits:
    - body: >-
        balenaOS v2.83.6 enables user namespacing by default making applications
        such as chromium unable to run.

        We override the kernel parameter `user.max_user_namespaces` in the
        application as a workaround.
