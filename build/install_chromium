# from the raspios repo (together with mesa and X), because
# * Since Debian 12, the upstream chromium provided in Debian repos
#   does not work on armv7 at all
# * The upstream chromium will not work on devices with < 1GB memory
#   namely the Pi3A and the PiZero2 even when using aarch64
# * The Raspberry Pi 5 needs patched versions of mesa and X to work
